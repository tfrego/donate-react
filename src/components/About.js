      <p className="about-text">Hello! My name is Trang. I created this app because I became a mom back in 2014 and my
        daughter changed my whole world. I was fortunate to be able to provide for her and couldnt
        imagine how it might feel for another struggling parent. I really wanted to connect with families
        in Seattle who needed a lift to get back on their feet and to gift what I no longer use.
        Also, I wanted to provide a place for families to feel welcome to reach out to their community when they
        could use some help. I hope you feel the same and will utilize this app as a means to help those around us.</p>
